# webrtc-video-chat-app
Video chat application using the WebRTC technology.

This application allows two people to communicate to each other in a private 'room'. The participants must enter a matching room name to get connected. Once
the connection is established, a real-time peer-to-peer-stream for video/audio trakcs is generated.

The room size is limited to two for now. Next I plan to extend the room size and integrate text chat to the room.
